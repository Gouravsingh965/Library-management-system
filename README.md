# Library-management-system
This is a Library Management System that I developed using C++ with Object-Oriented 
Programming principles, and MySQL as the database backend. The system supports both 
Admin and User roles and allows basic library operations like adding books, registering 
students, borrowing books, and displaying book availability.
